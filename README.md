# NodeJS Setup

#### How to run the server:

1. Install NodeJS, then run the following commands
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start-dev`

#### A beautiful NodeJS Structuring, to make scalable applications, easier project management & simple to understand code

A great structuring for NodeJS:

    * Components (Routes, Middlewares & Controllers)
    * Services
	* Config Keys (.env)

#### Amazing structure to make scalable projects
You can create **new components** / **subcomponents**, which makes **scaling your app** a lot easier

**Config Keys** - You put the development and testing keys here, and when you set up your Web you put the production keys in the server only (prod.js is ignored by .gitignore for security reasons)
